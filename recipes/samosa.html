    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Making samosa dough</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Start making samosa dough. To a large bowl, add flour, ajwain (carom seeds), salt and mix well</li>
        <li>Add the oil to the mixture then start mixing with your fingers. Rub the flour with oil until the oil is well incorporated in all of the flour. Do this for 3 to 4 mins, you don't want to rush this step. Once incorporated , the mixture resembles crumbs.</li>
        <li>Press some flour between your palm- it should form a shape (it shouldn't crumble) - means oil is enough and well incorporated.</li>
        <li>Now start adding water, little by little and mix to form a stiff dough. Don't overwork the dough and don't knead a soft dough. It should just come together and form a stiff dough. Used around 6 tablespoons of water.</li>
        <li>Cover the dough with a moist cloth and let it rest for  40 minutes. Soak a paper towel in water squeeze out all the water and cover the dough or use a damp cloth. While the dough rests work on the filling.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Making the potato filling</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil potatoes until done. For 8-10 minutes whilst on high heat with natural pressure release of using stove-top pressure cooker or instant pot, high pressure 12 minutes with natural pressure release on a trivet with one cup of water at the bottom of the pot. </li>
        <li>Peel the skin and mash the potatoes. Set aside. Heat two tablespoons of oil in a pan on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the cumin seeds, fennel seeds and crushed coriander seeds. <br>
        Let the seeds sizzle for a few seconds then add the chopped ginger, green chilli and hing. Cook for one minute</li>
        <li>Add the mashed potatoes and green peas to the pan. Mix everything well together. I use a potato masher to combine the peas, spices and seasoning well</li>
        <li>Add coriander powder, garam masala, amchur, redd chilli powder and salt. Mix to combine. Once its properly mixed, remove pan and let it cool for a bit.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Shape and fry samosa</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Once the dough has rested, give it a quick knead. Divide the dough into 7 equal parts of around 55-60 grams each.
            <br>
            Start working on the piece of dough, <em>keep the remaining dough balls covered at all times with a moist cloth</em> else it wil dry out.
        </li>
        <li>Roll one dough ball into a circle-oval shape, around 6-7 inches in diameter and then cut it in two.</li>
        <li>Take one part apply water on the straight edge/side. I use a mixture of flour and  water that acts like a glue.
            <br>
            Now bring the two ends of the straight edge together and pinch them to form a cone.
        </li>
        <li>Fill the samosa with the potato filling, around 1-2 tablespoons.<em> Don't overfill the samosa.</em></li>
        <li>Now again apply the water/glue around the surface of the cone as you have to seal it. Pinch the opposite side (opposite to where you pinched the cone) to form a plate. Then pinch the edges and seal the samosa.</li>
        <li>Your samosa is now ready, repeat the process above with the remaining dough. Always remember to keep filled samosa covered with a moist cloth while rolling and filling the others. You will get 14 samosas.</li>
        <li>Now heat oil in a wok/pan on low heat. To check if oil is ready insert a small piece of dough into the oil. It should take a few seconds to resurface. That means the oil is ready.
            <br>
            Drop the samosas into the oil.
        </li>
        <li>Fry on low heat. After around 10-12 minutes, the samosa becomes firm and light brown in color, at this point increase the heat to medium and fry till golden brown.
            <br>
            Do not put too many samosas into the pan at once fry at most 4-5 samosas at a time. Patience is encouraged as each batch takes around 20 minutes to cook.
        </li>
        <li>Once you finish frying one batch, lower the temperature and <em>wait for a few minutes</em> before adding the next batch.
            <br> 
            Enjoy the samosas with a cup of tea or a pumpkin dipping sauce.
        </li>
